# List of (almost) all OC chat commands

(document version 0.2)

These chat commands can be issued by typing the command as listed in local chat, with the wearer's collar prefix in front. Collar prefix is normally the first two letters of the wearer's name, though if you're not sure you can see the prefix in the collar's Help/About menu. Saying "* prefix" in local chat will tell you the prefix of any collar within 20m of you which you have access to.

EXAMPLE: If your name is "Bob" your prefix will be "bo". To issue a chat command listed below, you'd type "bo" in front of it. For example to open the main menu, you'd type "bo menu".

By default, collars will listen to both a private channel (by default channel 1) and the local chat channel (channel). Note that some users switch channel 0 listening off, as this reduces script load significantly. This is done with the "Listen0" button in the Settings menu, and honestly we recommend doing it. In this case you'll use channel 1 instead (i.e. "/1 bo menu").  The advantages of using the private rather than public channel are that your collar scripts will be doing much less work as they don't need to check every word spoken in local chat, and that people can't see what you're doing (until it happens!).

Very occasionally you'll find someone has changed the private channel to something other than the default channel. This can be done with the "channel" chat command (i.e "[prefix] channel 100" will set the private channel to 100 and you'd then use /100 rather than /1). The Help/About menu will show you the current channel setting.

IMPORTANT: Not all chat commands are case-insensitive (i.e some will require you to capitalize things correctly). If you see a command in the list below with a capital letter, you have to use it in that form. When you're referring to a specific function (for example the name of an animation or a restriction preset), use the capitalization of that animation, function, etc. There are a few places where we've made things case-insensitive, but not everywhere. If something doesn't work as expected, check your capitalization.

INDIVIDUAL RESTRICTIONS:
The following individual restrictions can be added or cleared with the above commands, using either the prettified button name for the restriction or its actual internal RLV command. Note that where a command requires a value (such as the camera max distance) it will apply the value that has been set in the relevant configuration menus. For more information on what each command does, consult the RLV API document at https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Protocol/RestrainedLoveAPI and look up the individual internal command.
