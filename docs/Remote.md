title: The OpenCollar Remote
---
You can get your OpenCollar Remote from the OpenCollar Headquarters -- look for a box near the OpenCollar vendor !  This page is updated to the Remote for OpenCollar V8.

The OpenCollar Remote is an HUD that lets someone with collar access open and operate subjects' collars from the HUD, if the collar is in range.  Many collar features can be accessed directly from the Remote through its dedicated buttons.  The Remote for OpenCollar V8 will also allow the wearer to open their own collar menu.   

When you add the Remote to an HUD point you get this image on your screen.  The plus icon is to expand the HUD, and the profile icon shows the active sub.
<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">

</div>  
Push the "Plus" icon to open the full menu.  It will take a few seconds to expand.   

Here is the full menu when open:
