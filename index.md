<p><img style="float: right; margin: 5px 15px 15px 5px;" src="/static/steelcollar.png" width="100" />OpenCollar (OC) offers a set of scripts for a D/s collar similar to other scripted collars in Second Life. Unlike most other collars, however, OpenCollar is open source. <br style="clear: both;" /></p>
 
You can read more about what that means at the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/osd-annotated). You are free to copy and redistribute the OC scripts, provided that you leave them full perms. Read the entire OpenCollar License in the notecard accompanying the scripts.  OpenCollar has been continuously operating since 2008 to provide our open source scripts contained in a working collar model free to the BDSM Community of Second Life.

# CURRENT FULL RELEASE:  OPEN COLLAR V 8.4
You can see the [Release Notes](https://opencollar.cc/ReleaseNotes) here.

## New in OpenCollar V 8.4:   
### Mult-source Relay
- easily capable of handling a good number of devices at the same time. 
### New Leash Code:
- Line-of-sight checking stops you getting trapped behind walls, or yanking you into the ceiling if someone you're leashed to logs in the floor above, etc.
- New "face" command turns the avatar to face a target.
- Non-RLV based option for turning the leashed avatar.
- New "strictish" leash mode, like strict but without fartouch.
- Multiple leashpoints now supported
### Avatar Parking 
- "Park" option in anim triggers groundsit and locks avatar in place until Park is switched off (or equal/higher auth uses Force unsit).  
### Cleaner Code 
- Far more resilient to Stack/Heap errors even when detach/force sit etc. is given crazy amounts of things to handle. 
### PBR Support 
- Collars now can use PBR materials and show/hide still works.
### Faster RLV Startup 
- Collars will now register RLV more quickly, and restore relay settings more promptly because of it.

## Mission

OpenCollar exists to support people exploring submission and domination in Second Life and other virtual worlds.  It is nonprofit and volunteer driven.  The project builds, maintains, distributes and supports these scripts and the community that uses them. We encourage creation by users as well as designers.  We encourage learning by examining the scripts and building with them. We encourage people to share their skills with others. Any user or developer is welcome to use our work as long as they abide by the license and pass on the same permissions they received.
