# OpenCollar V 8.3: Changelog
8.3 has been a while coming, but we hope this one is going to be worth it. It's the biggest update we've done in years and brings a number of tasty new features to OpenCollar as well as a whole host of smaller fixes, bug-squashing, and optimizations. As of 8.3 OC now has a new object interface to allow OC to interact with furniture and devices in new ways, a timer app that allows you to set time locks or trigger any OC function on a time delay and more.

OC and PBR (physically-based rendering): OC8.3 does not have support for PBR materials to be added to a collar at this time. That one's on LL. The scripting required to make show/hide functions compatible with PBR is incredibly clunky and inefficient, and potentially breaks content. LL have promised us that they are addressing the issue, but until they've actually done so, OC will not support PBR materials and we strongly advise you NOT to use PBR on collars until we're able to add this update (or LL implements an update that is compatible with current scripting). Doing so WILL break your show/hide functions.

OC and LSD (Linkset Data): We are in the process of transitioning OC to use the Linkset Data functions for storing data in a linkset rather than in script memory. This is a fantastic addition from LL that will eventually mean a significantly faster, more stable, and more capable OC. This represents a fundamental change to the OC architecture, which will take a while to fully implement it. OC9.0 will be the first version of OC to use LSD at its core. However we have a new app in 8.3, oc_timer, which is written using LSD functions and provides a template for how we will be using LSD going forwards. Scripters interested in contributing to the transition of OC to use LSD are urged to study this script.

## New Features

1.  Brand new timer App that allows timers to be set to release restrictions of all sorts, or indeed to add restrictions. Any command or combination of commands can be set to be triggered when the timer expires, so this can be used to release the wearer after a set time, or to execute time-delayed commands. Want to lock someone's attachments and have them released after a certain amount of time? Or leash them to a post and have the collar release them automatically after a set time? Or alternatively give them a couple of hours of freedom before they're teleported home, restricted from teleporting away, and stripped naked? All that's possible now!   An optional hover text countdown will show how long until timer expires. Optional wearer lockout will lock the wearer out of their own collar while the timer is active,  allowing e.g.  the full scope of self-bondage possibilities for self-owned collar wearers. (Created by Medea Destiny)   
2. Object interface channel reintroduced and expanded. External objects can now access collar functions with the auth level of the object owner, or optionally the auth level of the object USER if it is equal or lower than the object owner. This will allow for OC powered furniture and devices similar to those that use an RLV relay, except using OpenCollar's own auth functionality, and allowing access to all OC functions not just RLV ones, such as posing and leashing. A new Grabby Post has been created using this feature, as well as a more advanced, menu-powered Smart Post that can pick a target from a menu, leash them, pose them, and add restrictions. The script for the Smart Post is heavily commented to act as an example device for creators to make their own devices. (Created by Medea Destiny)   
3. New improved bell sounds. (Provided by Trix7125)   
4. Improved Runaway handling, # prefix (similar to * to target all collars in range but excluding command issuer's own collar) restored & numerous internal optimizations (provided by Nikki Lacrima)   
5. Optional partner-controlled permission system for couple anims that will remove the need to accept animation permission when receiving a couple animation from a compatible device. This will be built into the next version of the owner hud soon, which means that if an owner orders their sub to hug them, they won't have to additionally accept the permission.  (Created by Rosalyn Russell)   
6. Extended chat handling of individual RLV restrictions now allows all restrictions to be added by chat commands using the standard RLV expression as well as by button name, and button names no longer require matching capitalization   
7. Stand offset checkbox added to anim menu, so that hover height will only offset stand poses (i.e. no animation is being played) when selected.   
8. When strict mode is active, leash holders may now force tp leashees even if they don't have a forcetp exception set by default.   
9. Extended Lockguard compatibility (provided by Nikki Lacrima)   
10. Updated help notecard with more basic information about the collar functions, and a much expanded list of chat commands, covering almost every available chat command in OC. (Medea Destiny and Trinkitz Resident)   
   
These are the things you'll notice. Behind the scenes we also have numerous small bug fixes, optimizations to improve the speed and memory use of the collar, and smaller fixes for things you probably didn't notice but some people do. For a full listing of changes since 8.2.3, see the per-script changes below. Notably we have refactored runaway, safeword, name and device name changing commands, restored the # prefix (everyone but me) function, streamlined menu handling, reduced link message overhead for chat commands, added owner ability to instantly end capture, fixed the issue with stack/heap collisions in dialog caused by Linden Lab increasing the amount of data sensors return, clear clothing locks on RLV Clear, fixed the stray restriction and more.
## Contributors
SPECIAL THANKS TO: Medea Destiny, who knows more about the collar code than anyone else and did a lot of work on 8.3; Nikki Lacrima who has done great work implementing a lot of important optimizations under the hood, unglamorous but vital work that might not grab the attention as much as adding fancy new features, but makes everyone's experience with OC better.

## Per-script changes

* oc_addons    

Ping (pingout.duffield)   
> April 2024            -  Fix at Initial Handshake to disregard any nearby rezzed collar. Ref Issue #1038
   
* oc_anim   

Medea (Medea Destiny)
> Nov 2023    - Added StandOffset checkbox button to Anim menu. This toggles use of hover height offset when no pose is selected (i.e. for stand animation). This has been a frequent
                problem in support, with people accidentally setting a stand offset. However as some people may use this it seemed better to keep the capability but have it switchable and default to off. Issue #1012
                
* oc_api
    *  Nikki Lacrima
    > * Aug 2023   Clear group on runaway issue #935     
    > * Nov 2023   Only wearer can initiate and confirm runaway, add link message "runaway_confirmed" and remove the g_iRunawayMode. 
    > * Add "#" prefix wildcard, issue #897
    > * implemented Yosty7b3's menu streamlining, see pr#963    
    * Medea (Medea Destiny)
    > * Nov 2023    Reformatted chat command handling for efficiency. Chat commands no longer sent as CMD_ZERO for authing as this script handles auth so we can auth locally to save a link_message round trip on every chat command. 
    > * Restored object command handling as per v7.x and previous, using interface channel rather than HUDchannel as there seems no reason to duplicate and hudchannel stuff hasn't  worked for a few years anyway.
    > * Added remote auth function - llSay(g_iInterfaceChannel,"checkauth 1111"); will return "AuthReply|(wearerkey)|(auth level)" on channel 1111, reporting the auth level of the object owner. Commands can be prefixed with"authas:(userkey)=", which will use the LOWER auth level between object owner and userkey.   
Commmand format is targetkey:chat command. Examples:  
                   > authas:(userkey)=(targetkey):kneel" - will issue kneel command if (userkey) and object owner
                    both have valid auth   
                    > "(targetkey):sit (sittarget key)" - sit wearer on (sittarget key) if object owner has validauth   
    > * menuto cleanup requires menuto target to be in sim AND be the owner of the issuing command
    > * Set g_iStartup to TRUE in active state on_rez event to restore "owned by" message #906  
    > * May 2024   Implemented wearerlockout for timer app and future rework of capture app, as well as future options for self-bondage, excluding wearer from all collar access etc. This uses Linkset data, the token being 'auth_WearerLockout". Any script that initiates a lockout should add its script name (excluding the "oc_" part to a comma-separated list, and remove itself from that list when removing, so that multiple scripts can apply this without interfering with each other.  When llLinksetDataRead("auth_WearerLocout") does not return an empty string, the only thing the wearer can do is safeword, which will deactivate it.  Any attempt to trigger a menu/command will send the AUTH_WEARERLOCKOUT Link message. Any script setting a wearer lockout should respond to this with a status update.  
    > * Sept 2024  -  Added rejection of interface channel commands from temp-attached objects
                    
* oc_bell   
Trix7125   
> * Feb 2024 - New bell sounds with normalized volumes   
AdmiralTails
> * Aug 2023 - Ringing of bell dependent on On status, not Hidden status, as menu states.
* oc_bookmarks   
Medea Destiny   
> * Aug 2024   -   Fix for above, escaping sim name with spaces, issue #1026
* oc_capture  
Ping (Pingout Duffield), Nikki Lacrima   
> * July 2023     - Owner ability to end Capture, Prevent BLOCKED from using Capture
* oc_core   
    * Medea Destiny   
    > * Oct 2023    -   Refactor of safeword function in usercommand. 'Safeword off' now no longer sets safeword to 'off' before disabling, resulting in confusing "Safeword is now set to 'off'" message. Instead safeword off is clearly notified. Wearer can now set their own safeword, but only owners can disable it still. See issue # 986. Attempting to access safeword without permission now gives no access response. 
    > * Provide no access notification for device name, and allow non-owner wearer to name. Notify wearer as well when another person changes device name. See issue # 987 
    > * Jul 2024   Further work on above safeword stuff, see PR #999 
    > * added delay after name change to ensure report is correct and added clarification text hereand in device name. Issue #1053   
    * Yosty7B3   
    > * Aug 2023    -   Combine all menu functions into the Dialog function to save memory.   
  
* oc_couples
Rosalyn (RosalynRussell)
> * Apr 2024   -   Added optional partner controlled couples pose system to remove legacy ask box if initiator is trusted   
* oc_detach   
Medea (Medea Destiny)
>  Nov 2023     Fix to ignore case (i.e either "menu detach" or "menu Detach") issue #875  
* oc_dialog   
    * Medea Destiny    
        > * Mar 2024  - Emergency fix for extended sensor function flooding memory and crashing script
    * Nikki Lacrima   
         > * Aug 2023 - Changed functions for clearing auth so  auth doesn't persist for open menus
         > * Sep 2024  - Invalidate all menus except wearer when public mode is turned off
    
* oc_folders
Neil2Ball & Sue Cripter - Fix for OpenSim, replacing invalid return r(); with {r(); return}    
* oc_folders_locks UNCHANGED   
* oc_label UNCHANGED   
* oc_leash   
 Medea (medea.destiny)  
    > * Nov 2023    -   Added EXC_REFRESH call after releasing strict leashto ensure that exceptions that should be in place get restored. issue #1008
    > * Aug 2024    -   Uses the above feature to add an accepttp function to strict leash, so that the leash wearer. Notification now sent to both leashee and leasher when leash is grabbed while strict mode is active, informing them of restrictions/exceptions.
    > *  Refactored timer event to fix bypassed awaycounter functionality so that the strict leash restrictions do not instantly get removed when leash holder is absent. Time buffer now functions as intended and is extended from 15 to 60 seconds to give leash holder time after a  teleport to send leashee a tp lure.    
Nikki Larima    
    > *  Nov 2023    - Remove processing of "runaway" command string, handled by CMD_SAFEWORD implemented Yosty7b3's menu streamlining, see pr#963   
      
* oc_meshlabel
Ping (Pingout Duffield) 
    > * Aug 2023 - Revise visibility when collar is hidden Ref Issue #932

* oc_outfits
    * Phidoux (Taya Maruti)
        > * Mar 2023       - Fixed lock issues with "~" and some navigation errors. (issue #910)
        > * June 2023      - Fixed Lock issue kAv instead of kID on the button check.
        > * June 20 2023   - Fixed Stray ~ that was causing detach to not work.   
    * Medea (Medea Destiny)   
        > * Nov 2023        - Fix for #902 (kAV instead of kID on button check) was not complete, No Access notify also changed to kAV
* oc_particle   
 Nikki Lacrima   
    > * Aug 2023: Updated for lockguard chain texture
    > * Sept 2024: Fix setting name for leash length
* oc_presets UNCHANGED
* oc_relay
Nikki Lacrima   
    > * Nov 2023   - Remove extra CMD_SAFEWORD to CMD_RELAY_SAFEWORD processing
    > * implemented Yosty7b3's menu streamlining, see pr#963  
* oc_resizer UNCHANGED              
* oc_rlvextension  
 Medea Destiny  
    > * Nov 2023   -   Added EXC_REFRESH link message capability to request all exceptions are refreshed. This to fix real leash temporary exception removing permanent exception, but likely to find other uses. This is less optimal than having a way to refresh individual exceptions, or even better having this script handle multiple source exceptions the way rlv_sys handles restrictions. However that's something to consider for 9.x where linkset data can reduce memory load, this one's already very tight. Issue #1008
    > * folded bool() function into checkbox() function with (iValue&1) and strReplace() into MuffleText() to save memory                    
* oc_rlvsuite   
    * Medea Destiny
        > * April 2023  -   #947 Fix stray restriction to apply sittp rather than sit restriction                    
        > * Nov 2023  -   Chat command for applying restrictions had problems -- if the restriction itself is given rather than the button name, it would break. Added sanity check to ApplyCommand function, index of g_lRLVList is now checked to see if it gets an RLVCMD and if so converts to index  of ButtonText, and returns if hit is CategoryIndex. Ensure the full command is fed to ApplyCommand, not just the first word -- ie (prefix) restriction add "TP Location" shouldn't attempt to add just "TP". NOTE: This fix will also allow presets with a space in the name to be accessed properly. 
        > * Changed filtering in UserCommand so that capitalization does not have to match (i.e it will accept "Preset" as well as "preset". Now also passes rlv as a synonym for setting restrictions which was coded but rejected before hit, but filters to only pass to ApplyCommand if there is a command following that is not "on" or "off" to avoid collision with RLV menu
        > * Removed double menu for (prefix) restrictions
        > * Jun 2024  -   Extended chat command function above to allow for capitalization of individual restriction names.    
    * Nikki Lacrima   
        > * Sept 2024 -   Remove superflous llOwnerSay commands and replace g_lMenuIDs (Yosty patch PR #963)      
* oc_rlvsys UNCHANGED
* oc_settings UNCHANGED
* oc_states UNCHANGED
* oc_themes UNCHANGED
* oc_titler   
Medea Destiny
    > * Sept 2023  Zero length titles via chat commands (i.e [prefix]title) were returning "title" as a title rather than opening the textbox as intended.  
* oc_timer   
    * Medea (Medea Destiny)   
    > * May 2024   -   Created script 
   * Ping (Pingout Duffield)
    > Jul 2024   -   Fixed typos in variable %WEARER% -> %WEARERNAME%

# V 8.2.2 Release:  Changelog

### Summary

In this release a mistake was made compiling the updater that was distributed to the groups, so that most of the scripts were still 8.2.1 although labeled 8.2.2.  When the error was  discovered, it necessitated another version change to avoid confusion, resulting in 8.2.3.      

## V 8.2.1 Release: Changelong 

### Summary 
The most noticeable changes to 8.2.1 are:
1. Restrictions/extensions refactoring: Restriction presets and individual restrictions now under a single menu rather than separated into Restrictions and Macros menus, with a major user interface overhaul including clearer button names, listings of current restrictions in the prompt, restriction settings now accessible directly from restrictions menu, and a button to inform user what restrictions the presets will actually put in place.  
2. Exceptions menu restored to RLV menu, and major efficiency overhaul.  
3. Far faster boot times  
4. STRICT SIT function now no longer clashes with other restrictions.   
5. Titler vastly less fussy about custom colour vectors and responds faster   

There are also numerous efficiency improvements, bug fixes and improvements to user interface and user feedback. 

## Complete Changelog

**Contributor Yosty7B3**
### oc_api:
> Removed unused StrideOfList() function to save memory
    
**Contributor Medea Destiny**
### oc_addons:    
> Provided auth failure mode for menu. Insufficient auth now provides suitable notification to user and respawns main menu. Fixes issue #665 

### oc_core: 
> Added sleep before notify for device name change, issue #672  
> Added confirmation messages when group or public access is toggled and fixed a typo  
> Efficiency pass, inlined majorminor(), docheckupdate() and docheckdevupdate().   
> Removed g_lTestReports, left over from alpha.   
    
### oc_dialog:
> Optimised substitutions by shortcutting no match for % in string after %NOACCESS% and %WEARER%.   
> Replaced GetTruncatedString function with far more optimised function.   
> Restored dialog chatting over-long prompts in local, which seems to have got lost somewhere. Improved version of function now works with prompts of any length and does not break up words.   
> Changed prompt for button descriptions in local chat from "Please check..." to "See..." to trigger it less often.   
> Added warning text to prompt when prompt is trunctated, so menu prompt text will now show "(CONT. IN LOCAL CHAT)".   

### oc_rlvextension:
> Moved Exceptions menu into RLV as a main directory, and folded Menu Settings into RLVSuite menu customize.   
> Refactored Exceptions setting with new functions to allow Exceptions to be applied individually (setUserExceptions() function), replaced ApplyAllExceptions() function with SetAllExes() that allows individual lists to be updated separately, and added list updating. Result is much cleaner setting of exceptions, where exceptions that have previously not been set don't get unset, and changing a single person on a  list doesn't require the entire list to be cleared and reset. One line of correct exceptions issued per user rather than one per exception per user, refreshed whenever anything needs updating. Result at bootup with a test collar with 8 people on owner/trusted list was 8 lines of RLV commands issued to viewer rather than up to 150 depending on timing of settings received.    
> Added list compare function that works.   
> Changed setting save function to allow individual settings to be saved rather than all settings being saved when any are changed.   
> Changed MenuSetValue() function so that the correct values were given for the blur function rather than sharing values with camdist settings, which gave incorrect user feedback. Reformatted handling of dialog response to cast returned string rather  than using list of conditionals.   
> Added remenu timer for force sit menu when unsit used, to delay scan so that object user is unsat from will show up in list rather than being ignored by scan if timing is such that it's still considered the object sat on by sensor.   
> Strict Sit changes: now adds own restriction to RLVsys baked set, which is removed when unsat. This avoids collisions between strict sit and other unsit restrictions. Restriction is now added immediately if user is sat on last force-sit object when setting is added, so that sit followed by strict sit will in fact stop the user standing.   
> UNSIT now uses the RLV_CMD_OVERRIDE function if the commanding user has owner auth. This means that a forced UNSIT by the owner is not stopped by a restriction to the wearer. Owners shouldn't be restricted by restrictions, wearers should. Previously the user would click unsit, be told it didn't work, have to navigate to restrictions, remove the restriction, navigate back to UNSIT, unsit the collar wearer, then navigate back to restrictions and reset it. This does that  automatically for owners.   
> Added explanatory text to exceptions and force sit menus.   
> Renamed Refuse TP to Force TP to reflect what the button actually does.   
    
### oc_rlvsuite: 
> Corrected values for Rummage and Dress restrictions, added @emote=n to Talk restrictions #649.   
> Restored SetDebug, SetEnv and Mouselook restrictions which had gone missing.   
> Added Camera settings & Muffle to restriction settings. Created shortcut to camera settings from camera restrictions category, and support correct BACK button behavior so it returns the user to whichever menu they arrived at that from #649.   
> **Menu Redesign** The individual restrictions subcategory menus are placed below the presets, on the basis that standard UI design principles call for detailed, multi-page functions to go lower in the attention hierarchy that quick, single-click preset functions. Various buttons/terminologies have been changed to try to make the whole thing more user-friendly. Also "macro" terminology has been removed, and preset used only where necessary to differentiate. issues #649 & # 654.   
> Added ListRestrictions() function which converts restriction integer pairs into human-readable lists of restrictions and given chat command "(prefix)restriction list". Also used by List Presets button, which lists what the preset restriction buttons actually do. #649   
> Given extensive explanatory text in menus. ListRestrictions() function is used to print out all restrictions the wearer is currently under, rather than requiring menu user to visit every category menu to find out.  #649   
> "Daze" preset renamed to "Names/Map", "Dazzle" to "Blur", and "Rummage" to "Inventory" because older names were downright confusing.  #649
> Changed some names in g_lRLVlist to be clearer #649.  
> Changed auth for adding/removing presets to CMD_OWNER AND CMD_TRUSTED to match the auth requirements of setting individual restrictions as short-term solution to issue #656.    
> Added Restore function to Customize menu to restore presets to defaults, per issue #663.   
> Rewritten dialog code to set individual restrictions, 'cos it was badly broken. Issue #664

### oc_rlvsys:
> Added RLV_CMD_OVERRIDE function. This allows one shot (=force) commands to be sent that will override any restrictions. This command should only be used where operator has owner permission. The notion behind it is that owners should not be restricted by wearer restictions. They can unset restrictions manually, perform the function, and then reset  the restriction, but that's a lot of hassle. This performs the function automatically. Operator and wearer are notified of  restrictions that have been temporarily restricted to avoid being misled that a restriciton is not present.

### oc_settings: 
> Tightened timings on release of all settings and reduced sleep padding on initialize. (Fix for faster boot)

### oc_states:
> Tighten timings and number of passes on reboot process and reduced sleep padding. (Fix for faster boot)

### oc_titler:
> Refactored SAVE to only save changed settings.   
> Added helpful menu text.   
> Added text2col() function that makes a sensible colour vector out of whatever is thrown at it. 
> Added validvector() function to confirm vectors are valid before setting, used to make "[prefix] title color" command without following vector provide colour menu rather than setting colour to black, and means that "[prefix] title color red" will now pop up the color menu rather than setting the title text to black. 
> Text changes now set instantly rather than after 2.5 second delay.   

# V 8.1 Release:  Changelog

## New Features for V 8.1  
### Global
> Expanded explanatory texts in many menus.  
> Restored menuto function to interface channel for backward compatibility  

### Access
> Wearers can now add to Trusted and Block List if Wearer Trusted is checked in Access.    
> Wearer now gets an accept/deny dialog when owner disables Runaway  

### Settings  
> Limit Range moved to Settings  
> Added warning to Settings print not to copy bookmarks to Settings notecard.  Instead, make a separate .bookmarks notecard.  
> **Listen 0** button added to turn off listening on channel 0 (local chat line).

### RLV > Folders  
> Added **Hide ~** Button to Folders / Configure to hide folders beginning with "~" (Give-to-RLV folders).  

### Undress App  
> Added chat commands: 
 >> `[prefix] undress [layer]` removes system layer. 
 >> `[prefix] undress lock [layer]` locks system layer.

## Bug Fixes

### Global  
Restored interface channel listener and Highlander code to disallow wearing multiple collars.
### Access
> Trusted is no longer able to unlock the collar  
> Trusted can no longer set Group or Public access
> Group Setting now clears correctly when changing group mode, and group mode can no longer be set if no group is active.

### Settings
Fixed permissions to print Settings so it is limited to owner and wearer.

### RLV
> Fixed incorrect handling of folder-level permissions for browsing #RLV (this was causing "Access Denied" notices to be sent for other actions).  
> Changing camera settings while restrictions are in place will now update the view in real time.
> Fixed Dazzle restriction not setting.

### Relay
> Corrected Relay so Access Denied -- Out of Range messages are no longer triggered and sent to object owners when an object incidentally chats a collar prefix.  
> Corrected Relay timing to improve recapture and avoid conflicts with internal collar rlv.   

### Undress App
Fixed oc_undress not displaying extended layers (alpha, tattoo, universal)

## V 8.0 Release:  Changelog

### New Features:  
- OpenCollar Remote can now be used by the collar wearer on their own collar
- There is now a "weld" capability.  
- You can add a setting using the Settings editor, useful for settings that have no corresponding menu button.  No need to create a notecard for these.
- "Stealth" is renamed "Hide/Show".
- Added the ability for the owner to disable hiding the collar.
- Included internal relay.
- Undress menu is now included in the standard updater and is found in Apps.  Updated for BOM layers.
- New themes creation ability for creators (only available on full permission collars).
- AddOns: New script makes it easier to connect other worn attachments and HUDs to the collar menu.

### All Scripts
- New startup sequence to fix settings problems. All scripts were updated to utilize the Callback feature, and will attempt to force-load all settings after hearing the initial TIMEOUT_READY signal. This is effectively 1 setting per second per script.
- Add DIALOG_TIMEOUT handling to scripts that were missing this signal handler
- Set memory limits in scripts to reduce the max available memory if a script never actually uses the full amount allowed by the simulator.
- Fix safeword enable/disable
     * Command to disable safeword is now: <prefix> safeword off
     * Command to re-enable safeword is to set the safeword to ANYTHING EXCEPT OFF: <prefix> safeword RED
- **SECURITY PATCH:** The collar now has a few security safeguards. In 7.5 there was an exploit that was discovered which utilized the collar remote to override the access list and even change the owners altogether. This manifested itself as something that would grab your relay then change your owners, masking the true cause of this exploit. This patch requires that all access list changes MUST go through the access menu or its related chat commands. The weld feature is also now safeguarded by a similar protocol, and is easy enough to bypass with legitimate intentions. If you plan to delete anything in the intern namespace, just pass the key value of "origin", and for anything in the auth namespace, same, just pass "origin" as the key value. This same security policy is also applied to the load url command. If the URL contains auth list modifications, it will block it from happening, unless the user reviews the URL contents and consents to said modifications.

### New Scripts  
- oc_api : 
    * New: Addons subsystem
    * Handles auth
    * Handles chat commands
    * Handles safeword  
- oc_core :
    * New: Settings Editor
    * Additional fix: Version checker code fixed
    * New version numbering scheme: MAJOR . MINOR. Build 
- oc_states :
    * Handles Settings Editor  
    * Handles Anti-Crash
    * Handles startup sequence
    * Manages script time by shutting off idle scripts and turning them on when needed.
- DEPRECATED: oc_com, oc_auth, oc_sys  
   * oc_auth, oc_com, oc_sys combined into oc_api, oc_core
        

### Revised Scripts

- oc_anim : 
   * Full rewrite with anti-slide kept in mind. Anti-slide is no longer able to be turned off, it also now attempts to circumvent most AOs that use higher priority animations.
   * Reuploaded animations from github as higher priority due to commercial AOs being improperly imported at priority 3 or 4 .
- oc_bell : Code cleanup  
- oc_capture : 
       * Added on/off chat commands.
       * Added more checks against the Enabled status.
       * Added code to prevent blocked users from capturing
- oc_detach: Added sorting of the attachments alphabetically.
- oc_dialog:  Implemented the ability to sort UUID lists
- oc_folders:  Full rewrite.
- oc_leash:  Added leash start and end movement signals.
- oc_outfits:  
       * Updated default checkboxes.
       * Changed "remove" chat command to "naked".
       * Added a Remove command to the Core Browser.   
- oc_particle: 8.0 specific modifications to settings naming, and leashpoint fixing so leashes dont bounce between targets, take closest target, or leash holder, and prefer leash holder over coffle to a worn collar.
- oc_remote:  Converted to an addon to connect to the Addon subsystem.
- oc_rlvsuite:  
       * Renamed "Accept_Perm" to "Permissions".   
       * Re-organized menus:  Macros appears in the main RLV menu alongside Restrictions, which now leads directly to restrictions by type.
- oc_settings: 
       * Rearranged script and cleaned up.
       * Made oc_settings handle weld
       * Load URL now uses a consent dialog if the policy for auth and intern says to reject
       * All tokens are now lowercase. All plugins need to use case insensitive checks, note: only the token_var portion of the token is forced to lowercase by settings
- oc_themes:
    * Fully Rewritten
    * Old themes format no longer compatible
    * New themes format is fully customizable and works for prims and for mesh with a single script.
- oc_undress:  Fully rewritten to take advantage of the BakesOnMesh universal layer.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## V 7.5  (aka V7.4.1)   
OpenCollar V 7.5 should be named OpenCollar V 7.4.1 but due to naming restrictions left over from V6 days we can't name it that.  So V 7.5 it is.  V 7.5 includes a bug fix to the force sit and could not wait to be released.   
**Dateline 22 April 2020**

As always, every old and new script on this list is licensed under the GPL V2.

## V 7.4   

OC 7.4 is a major release, involving physical changes to the scripted prims.  Rolling back to previous versions is not possible using just an updater.     
**Release Date 07 April 2020**   
Thanks to everyone who contributed to V 7.4, including but not limited to Aria (tashia redrose), Nirea, Medea Destiny, Lillith Xue, Sharie Criss, Toy Wylie, Romka Swallowtail, roan (Silkie Sabra), bunny (emmapais) and many beta testers.

# Current Full Release: V 7.3

Release date: 22 July 2019

## User Summary

OC 7.3 is a maintenance release repairing a bug in V 7.2, improving menus throughout the collar, and adding a sort feature to the detach menu.  

- Repairs a bug in capture where the captor would be unable to release, and safeword was required. Capture now functions as expected.  [Issue #227](https://github.com/OpenCollarTeam/OpenCollar/issues/227), thanks to Ray Zopf for finding the bug and Aria (Tashia Redrose) for fixing it.
- Repairs a bug that required wearers to fix menus after updating.  Menus should now appear reliably after updates. [Issue #230](https://github.com/OpenCollarTeam/OpenCollar/issues/230). Thanks to Medea Destiny for identifying the problem and fixing it.
- Adds a feature that sorts Detach by similar names to make it easier to read the list of attached items. [Issue #226](https://github.com/OpenCollarTeam/OpenCollar/issues/226). Thanks to Minesweeper M for the suggestion and contributing to the code.

-Other Credits:  Nirea for review, fixes and final approval.  

# Older Versions

## V 7.2

Release date: 14 July 2019

## User Summary 

OC 7.2 release is mainly a maintenance release. That's to say that most of the changes are under the hood and won't be all that apparent to the user. We have fixed numerous bugs and improved the efficiency of the collar in various ways. Things you should be aware of: 

- Capture mode now has slightly more restrictive permissions for the captor - they were granted a little too much power. 

- Access denied messages now report what access has actually been denied for - they weren't too helpful before. 

- Leash menu now has a "Give holder" button that will provide a leash holder to use.  New mesh leash holder by Salt(xxsaltandpepperxx)!  

- When sit restrictions are removed, you will be informed that you can stand rather than forced to stand. 

- Relay no longer overrides ASK mode for objects owned by someone with owner permission on your collar if the owner is the collar wearer, or if the owner is not currently in the sim. Similarly, auto accept for landowner setting defaults back to ASK mode if the landowner is the collar wearer, to avoid trouble at home. 

## FOR COLLAR MAKERS:  

- Themes now supports faces and materials.  
- A plugin template script is now available on the github here: https://github.com/OpenCollarTeam/OpenCollar/blob/master/src/spares/oc_plugin_template.lsl

## The Details 

- General
    * Added a versions command. This will output the script versions (May not reflect current collar script version, it will reflect the last version in which the script was updated)
    * Added a debug command. This will output script settings on instant message to the requester, This is READ ONLY. Settings cannot be modified by a debug dump.
    * Removed the hard-to-read tiny numbers used in several version strings and replaced with real easy-to-read numbers
    * Added Toy Wylie animations.
    * General improvements to reporting reasons for insufficient access reporting in many scripts.
    * Leash handle provided by Salt&Pepper
    * Various typos and code clean ups
- oc_anim  
    * Capitalization and misc formatting corrections. 
    * Added Checkbox helper function  
    * Script readability improvements
- oc_auth
    * A fix for capture having too much access, will now prevent certain menus being used if captured
    * Will now prompt to confirm disabling OwnSelf
    * Fix for confusing text
    * Various code tweaks
- oc_bell
    * Only added access denied explanations
- oc_bookmarks 
    * Now ignores group and public access to prevent spam
- oc_capture
    * Added new token: isActive
- oc_com
    * Add in llToLower to make sure that prefix is case-insensitive
- oc_dialog
    * Added ability to add an explanation for what access was denied to
    * Fixed what auth returns for public, group, and everyone who should_not_have_access_to_the_collar!
    * Public/Group will now return NO_ACCESS if you are not within range of the collar.   
 - oc_exceptions
    * Clears exceptions before setting new ones to avoid stale entries
    * Bug fixes & efficiency clean up     
- oc_leash
    * Made it so passing the leash permits new leash holder to either pass it or unleash. Previously they would get an Access Denied message.
    * Floating in air after going down stairs or a hill, etc, has been resolved.
    * Misc settings fix due to new oc_settings behavior to prevent a infinite loop
    * Leash Holder giving ability now implemented.  Thanks to Salt (xxsaltandpepperxx) for the nifty new leash holder !
- oc_relay
    * Safeword will now cause the relay to ignore all requests for 20 seconds, and release all grabbed objects.
    * Landowner trusted now OFF by default
    * Landowner trusted mode simulates ASK mode for when landowner is wearer - people getting trapped by their own stuff too often!
    * ASK mode no longer trumped by owner list in cases where a. the owner is the collar wearer (so you can still be ASK to your own items), or if the owner is not in the sim (as auth generally derives from the object owner, and we shouldn't assume that the relay setting should be trumped by the owner's objects when that owner isn't actually around).
- oc_rlvsuite
    * Terminal now has a way to configure whether public/group/trusted/wearer are allowed or denied access to the terminal. Default is only Owner, Wearer, Trusted.
    * Removed misc. leftover VD references.
- oc_rlvsys
    * Sensors have been removed.
    * Inform wearer when sit restriction is removed rather than force unsitting them.
- oc_settings
    * Will now confirm loading settings from URL
    * [API] On save / delete it will echo back the request
        * for save it will send LM_response, 
        * for delete it will send LM_delete
- oc_sys
    * Changed the update detection URL to point to the right file in github
    * Removed spammy news
    * Added a .settings notecard relay. Enables placing .settings into root prim instead of only in the Settings prim
    * As of 7.2 RC3 / Full Release, if the .settings notecard is not changed, reboot not requested, or load not requested from Settings, the .settings will not be relayed if it has already been read- This is to avoid unnecessary link messages.
    * If an animation is added to the inventory in root prim, it will automatically move the animation.
    * Backwards compatibility fix for legacy "Add-ons" scripts
    * Fixes for proper capture permissions.
- oc_themes
    * Added support for materials textures.
    * Fixed script error.
    * Formatting clean up.
    * Added support for object faces.
- oc_titler
    * Particles now honor the last rank as well as the title.
- .couples notecard
    * Removed reference to 'nom' animation.

## 7.1

- Remove the limits of 3 owners, 15 trusted, 9 blocked, and 1 tempowner.
  Replace with shared limit of 28 people across all those lists.
- Add new "Detach" button to the RLV menu, and associated "detach" command.
  This feature shows the user a list of the collar wearer's attachments, and
  allows you to detach them.
- Added a new "image" command that uses the titler prim to show an image
  above the wearer's head.  Thank you Mano Nevadan for the pull request.
- Added OPTIONAL bundle type to the installer, for addons like oc_bookmarks that
  users might have intentionally removed.
- Added new STOPPEDSCRIPT item type to bundles, for handling scripts that need to
  be loaded into child prims.  (Replaces hardcoded special treatment of bundle
  "23" in the bundle handler.)
- Use explicit list of scripts in PermsCheck instead of oc_* prefix, reducing
  spam for users of closed source third party plugins that use that prefix.
- Fixed upgradeability of collar versions 3.0 through 3.2.  Thank you
  Nataliaa Wirefly for the bug report and testing.

## 7.0

- Returned to fully GPL version of OpenCollar scripts.
- Returned to license requiring the scripts to remain full perms in Second Life.  (No more no-mod oc_root script.)
- Removed "FailSafe" kill switch function from all scripts.  We found several versions of this function.  All versions would cause the script to silently delete itself if you messed up permissions or renamed the script.  All were somewhat obfuscated, using raw integers instead of the normal constants for permissions masks and inventory types.  Some versions of FailSafe deleted other inventory in the prim, such as notecards and animations.  Some versions were triggerable by a link message.  We have replaced FailSafe with a new PermsCheck function that is de-obfuscated, doesn't delete anything, provides helpful suggestions for users/creators who want to get the permissions right, and allows renaming the script.  Thank you Corwin Davidson for reporting this.
- Returned to pre-6.6 update protocol.  If you provide 3rd party plugins and found that your installer wouldn't work with 6.6/6.7, it should work again with 7.0.
- Removed code that sent IMs to "Shycoconut Resident" if the collar was set no-modify for the current or next owner. Thank you pixelwork for the pull request.
- Removed the "seal" feature, .distributor notecard requirement, and the obfuscated "JB()" code that supported it from oc_sys and oc_com. This was unnecessarily cumbersome for third party creators and provided a false sense of security.  (Given that it was implemented in user-editable code, there was never anything preventing anyone from making their collar claim to be someone else's "official" release.)
- Removed VirtualDisgrace-specific branding and links.
- Renamed "Vanilla" to "OwnSelf"
- Added mechanism for safely updating animations and preventing duplicates.
- Removed dozens of unused variables and functions.
- Fixed problem with oc_couples not re-reading config notecards on change.
- Added support for updating collars as far back as 3.x.
- Add oc_bookmarks back to the default updater.
