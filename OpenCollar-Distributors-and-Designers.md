# OpenCollar Partners Application Form

Want to receive an OpenCollar Vendor and get on this list? Copy the text below to a notecard and send it to [Yshida](secondlife:///app/agent/4d5a5a8f-5ffa-419a-8bf2-361d40faac4a/about) inworld.

OpenCollar Official Partners

OpenCollar offers the Official Partners program for people who wish to host a publicly accessible OpenCollar vendor. Official Partners are listed on a page on the OpenCollar website/wiki, and we'll refer users to that page when they inquire about where to find OpenCollar-based products.

To qualify as an OpenCollar Official Partner, collar distributors agree to the following*:

--Requirements
 
1. Place the vendor in a publicly accessible parcel with no ban lines and no prior restrictions to access except for cause or TOS violations such as age play.   
2. Do not host vendors for OpenCollar products that fail to meet the standards for Designers (see below).  
3. If an official OpenCollar Partner also distributes house or privately produced collars with altered scripts or settings, the collars must comply with the OpenCollar license where applicable. The modifications must be clearly marked and wearers informed.

--Benefits

1. Name  and inworld location SLURL listed on OpenCollar's Official Partners page.  
2. An initial announcement to the OpenCollar group that you've been made an Official Partner.  
3. The right to use the "OpenCollar Official Partner" name in the description of your inworld parcel.  

APPLICATION

If you would like to sign up for the Official Partners program, please make a notecard named  "OpenCollar Official Partners Application - (your user name)", and include the information indicated below.  Then pass it to [Yshida](secondlife:///app/agent/4d5a5a8f-5ffa-419a-8bf2-361d40faac4a/about), OpenCollar Partners Coordinator.

DISTRIBUTORS AND DESIGNERS:

SecondLife Username:  
* The User Name

Secondlife Avatar UUID:
* The Avatar UUID is your key or the string of characters at the top of your profile.

Name and brief description of your sim:  

* Playground | Roleplay | Shop | Club | Sandbox | Other

\* Distributors may be removed from the list if they fail to meet any of the above specifications.
