# OpenCollar AO
The OpenCollar AO is a simple animation overrider that comes loaded with several animation sets, including two versions of "Girl" and "Boy", plus Pony, Crawl and Worm. The AO will sync with OpenCollar V7 as long as both are worn.  The AO includes a built in "AntiSlide" feature that allows you to walk while a collar pose is active.  It allows collar owners to Load and Lock animation sets.

`[prefix] ao` calls the AO menu.  Access to the AO menu is limited to owners and trusted.
