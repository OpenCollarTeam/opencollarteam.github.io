The Leash is keyed to access rank. Public Access, Group Access, and Trusted cannot take the leash if the wearer is leashed to the Owner. If OwnSelf is unchecked, the wearer cannot unleash herself from any rank of access without using the collar safeword. If the wearer initiates the leash using Pass, the wearer can unleash.

## Configure
In this menu you can change the texture of the leash particles, and also set rlv restrictions on the leashed avatar.  

**Customizing note**  You can add your own textures to the leash.  There are two classes of texture, Classic and Ribbon.  Rename your texture starting with either `!ribbon` or `!classic` plus one character such as a space or underline, followed by your custom texture name as you want it to appear on a button; for instance, `!ribbon_rope` will show up in the Leash > Configure menu as "Rope".  Drop the renamed texture into the root prim which also contains the oc_particle script.  There is a limit of one extra button each for a custom ribbon and a custom classic particle texture.

### Strict
