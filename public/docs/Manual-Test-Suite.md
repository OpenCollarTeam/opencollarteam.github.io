This is a list of things to try when testing a new OpenCollar release.  It's a work in progress.  Please add more!

If you're running tests and find an issue, please report it at https://github.com/OpenCollarTeam/OpenCollar/issues.

# Update

- Try updating an older collar (3.X-6.5) using a regular updater.  You should see no error messages.  The version number in dialogs should be updated.
- Try updating a 6.6/6.7 collar using the seed script and a regular updater. 
- Try updating a V7.X collar using a regular updater.
- Set an owner.  Update the collar.  Check that the owner is still set.
- Try removing animations from your collar's Animator prim, then doing an update.  The animations should be replaced.
- Try having both a .couples card and a !couples card in the animator prim.  Customizations to the .couples card should be overwritten by an update, but customizations to !couples should not.
- Try deleting the "nadu" animation from your collar, and then renaming "tower" to "nadu".  Then do an update.  Both "tower" and "nadu" should be replaced.
- Put a no-copy "nadu" animation into the animator prim, then do an update.  It should be left in place (we never delete/replace no-copy anims).
- Check the "Experience" attached to the scripts in the updater.  It should be the "OpenCollar" experience owned by "nirea" for all scripts.  (We're not using any experience-specific features in the collar yet, but are using it so users who want to verify that they have an unmodified official version can do so.)

# Interface

- Touching the collar should bring up the main menu.
- Using the "menu" command should bring up the main menu.
- The main menu should have a link to the OC group and/or documentation.
