# Group Charter for OpenCollar and OpenCollar R&D

This page expresses how we want to see our groups interact.  See our Mission Statement to read about the goals of the OpenCollar project.

# Our Guiding Rule
When people come to OpenCollar chat, they should find a group that is supportive and welcoming. 

There will be conflicts and disagreements, and it's natural for people to be drawn to conflict.  People love a fight.  They even like to egg people on, or pick a side and revel in some righteous indignation while trying to tear the other side down. Let's resist that temptation.

If you want to help, promote, or defend OpenCollar, find a way to do it with kindness, patience, and even love.  We're not here to fight.  We're here to build something great for Second Life.

# Applications

The above rule has a number of applications.

## Chat and Interaction:  
* Don't argue with the moderators.  
* Treat other members and staff with courtesy and tolerance, and keep an open mind.   
* No verbal abuse, personal attacks, or unsolicited criticisms of OpenCollar policy, product, or personnel, or any other product, group or person. This includes insults, mocking people, asking aggressive rhetorical questions or making accusations about people's character.  
* Support the TOS/CS regarding harassment, prejudice and defamation.
## Support Priorities
* OpenCollar is for general user support, OpenCollar R&D is for scripting, building and tech support.  
* Don't let chatter interfere with support questions. If a support staff member is there to help, let them help.   
* Don't try to answer support questions unless you're sure of the information.  Do jump in if you know the answer.    

## Advertising and Spam 
* Do not use the group as your personal forum for soliciting, advertising, self promotion or hooking up.  
* All non-support related chat should be addressed to the group as a whole, not targeting one segment or individual members.  
* No repetitive spam. Repeatedly asking the same question over and over when answers have been provided may be considered spam.  

# Moderation
When violations occur, moderators are trusted to apply the corrective action they think is most appropriate, whether that's warning, muting, ejecting, or banning. Lead Moderators and group owners are extremely unlikely to override a moderator's decision.  However, if you think a decision was wrong, you can send a notecard of the chat to one of the lead moderators. If you think a lead moderator's decision was wrong, you can appeal to one of the group owners. Moderators are expected to maintain a welcoming and supportive tone even when correcting people who have stepped out of bounds.
