You can get your OpenCollar Remote from the OpenCollar Headquarters -- look for a box near the OpenCollar vendor !  This page is updated to the Remote for OpenCollar V8.

The OpenCollar Remote is an HUD that lets someone with collar access open and operate subjects' collars from the HUD, if the collar is in range.  Many collar features can be accessed directly from the Remote through its dedicated buttons.  The Remote for OpenCollar V8 will also allow the wearer to open their own collar menu.   

When you add the Remote to an HUD point you get this image on your screen.  The plus icon is to expand the HUD, and the profile icon shows the active sub.
<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">

</div>  
Push the "Plus" icon to open the full menu.  It will take a few seconds to expand.   

Here is the full menu when open:

# How to Use

Once you have a subject to whom you have some kind of collar access, add them to the Remote.  :

1 - Press the Add/Remove Nearby Avatars button and select their name.  They will get a permission request to be added to the remote.  They have to say yes.  
2 - Because the Remote is an AddOn, it appears in the AddOns menu of the wearer's collar when it's connected, and it can only connect to one collar at a time. To switch collars, go to the Favorites or Nearby Avatars button and select the next collar.
3 - If the Remote has not used the active collar in several minutes, you will get this message:  "[X collar]: Addon: OC_Remote has been removed because it has not been seen for 5 minutes or more."
