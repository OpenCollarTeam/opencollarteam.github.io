This document is a guide to  the creation, distribution and sale of third party plugins and addons for OpenCollar products.  

## LICENSES

Scripts of completely original material, derived only from OpenCollar public domain scripts--such as the plugin template--or that only use code designed to interface with OpenCollar scripts--such as the Plugin API defined in this document--may be released by creators under any license they wish without restriction.

Any script derived from the OpenCollar open source scripts, in whole or in part, must retain the same permissions as the scripts they are derived from--namely full permissions to copy modify and transfer; with the exception of the plugin template itself or similar listener code whose sole purpose is to link your plugin to the OpenCollar object.

Any resource licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode) must retain the permssions you received.  Resources include models, animations, sounds, textures, images and particle effects.

Any OpenCollar resource or script you distribute along with your plugin must include a copy of the respective OpenCollar license. The OpenCollar GPL maybe be found here:  https://github.com/OpenCollarTeam/OpenCollar/blob/master/LICENSE.

## BEST PRACTICES

Creators are free to set Second Life share permissions for their creations however they wish within the confines of the above license. However, for end user convenience it is advised that separate copy/modify and modify/transfer versions of the script be made available to avoid the end user having a no copy/no transfer object.

The prefix "oc_" and the word "OpenCollar" and its derivatives are reserved for use in only official OpenCollar script names. To prevent end user confusion, plugins should use their own prefix and/or brand name.

Scripts that use RLV may send their own @commands, but must honor all RLV_* management calls sent from the OpenCollar scripts. Using OpenCollar's built-in RLV management will provide automated enablement/disablement, as well as viewer compliance checking, and integration with other OpenCollar RLV features.
